# Mona's MyReads Project

This is the 6th out of 7 projects for the Udacity program. 
It is a library app, that helps sort your books into three catogories. 

This project's primary focus was getting to know REACT better. 

Udacity provided us with the starter code, but we did have the option to do this from scratch.

 [Udacity's starter code](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)

Which was primarly  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
They also included the BooksAPI's and the backend server configurations. 
 
# Getting started 

To get the application up and running, you can either clone or down my code [Mona's MyReads Project](https://github.com/thenewmona/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) 

Then you will do a NPM install, followed by a NPM start in the command line or terminal. 

This will start the application, and let you manuever around the library, and change the books.

You will be to see and change the books from currently reading, want to read, and read.

There is also a search page which can be accessed by clicking the + sign in the lower right hand corner.
