# sortby

sortby orders JavaScript arrays using a MongoDB-like syntax.

## Installation

    $ npm install sortby

## Quick Start

First you need to add a reference to sortby in your application.

```javascript
var by = require('sortby');
```

Then you can use it to sort arrays using a sort configuration object as used in MongoDB.

```javascript
var users = [
  {
    firstName: 'Tim',
    lastName: 'Cook'
  }, {
    firstName: 'Steve',
    lastName: 'Jobs'
  }, {
    firstName: 'Tim',
    lastName: 'Berners-Lee'
  }
];

console.log(users.sort(by({ firstName: 1, lastName: -1 })));
// => { firstName: 'Steve', lastName: 'Jobs' },
//    { firstName: 'Tim', lastName: 'Cook' },
//    { firstName: 'Tim', lastName: 'Berners-Lee' }
```

## Running the build

This module can be built using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Besides running the tests, this also analyses the code. To run Grunt, go to the folder where you have installed sortby and run `grunt`. You need to have [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) installed.

    $ grunt
